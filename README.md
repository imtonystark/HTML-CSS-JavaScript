# HTML-CSS-JavaScript
Examples utilizing HTML with CSS, and JavaScript

This repository contains simple examples from my own coursework in a university class on Web Development fundamentals.
I have provided them merely to document a proficiency in the material, and they should probably not be regarded as examples of best practices, or to reflect my present skillsets as a whole (read: much of this was old news when i wrote them, and i've moved on to learning newer things). 

That said, i'd suggest cloning the repository to a local directory, and the examples viewed using the Google Chrome Browser.

Ex. 
-----
git clone https://github.com/imtonystark/HTML-CSS-JavaScript.git
