<p style="text-align: left;">The first round, or "block", of Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009.
   Created by the mysterious person(s) identifying by the assumed name Satoshi Nakamoto, 	
   Bitcoin is regarded as the first "successful" attempt at a digital currency.
   Earlier attempts at the concept have been documented as early as the
   1980's, with none gaining any real success or notoriety. Many experts 
   attribute the success of Bitcoin to a working solution for the "double spend" 
   problems that plagued previous tokens/currencies.
   
   Today there are hundreds of digital "coins" to choose from, traded at 
   varying values on exchange markets. At the present time, three major 
   currencies are experiencing widespread success - Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.
